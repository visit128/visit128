        <p class="anime county__paragraph">In Mendocino County, Highway 128 begins just northwest of Cloverdale and snakes its way through the Yorkville Highlands—an appellation consisting of approximately 40,000 acres straddling Highway 128—to Anderson Valley and Boonville—the home of "boontling"—and then under a canopy of redwoods to mile marker 0 at Highway 1 and the Navarro River Bridge. Along the way, stop and savor not just the wine but the beauty of the surroundings. From the "Petit Tetons" of Yorkville to the deep end of Anderson Valley, 29 tasting rooms, and many others open by appointment only, offer fine wines, a chance to meet the winemaker, and exceptional hospitality.</p>

                      <p>Wild grapes certainly grew in abundance in early Napa Valley, but it took settler George Calvert Yount to tap the area's potential for cultivating wine grapes. Yount built one of the homesteads in the area and was the first to plant Napa Valley grapes in 1839.</p>
                       <p>Charles Krug is credited with establishing Napa Valley's first commercial winery in 1861. His success and leadership sparked a wave of new growth, and by 1889 there were more than 140 wineries in operation, including Schramsberg (founded in 1862), Beringer (1876) and Inglenook (1879). The majority of which can be found along Highway 128. <a href="http://wordpress.napahistory.org/wordpress/" class="historic-text" >Learn More &raquo;</a></p>

                      Dine in an elegant hotel, a corner café, a picturesque inn, or with spectacular views of vineyards, mountains, coastline, or riverfront. From local roadhouses and burger joints to Michelin Star restaurants, from traditional American staples to innovative ethnic fusion cuisines, Sonoma County chefs typically use the best local vegetables, fruits, meats, seafood, and other ingredients to create their delicious dishes. Farm to table isn’t a slogan or a trend in Sonoma County restaurants, it’s an ongoing way of life in a region where nature has been abundantly generous.

                      Few regions offer more of the character of Old California than Sonoma County. Museums and historical sites countywide celebrate the culture and impact of native tribes, Russian fur traders and colonists, Spanish missions and Mexican ranchos, and American settlers. State historic parks highlight the Russian coastal colony, writer Jack London’s ranch, and Mission San Francisco Solano, the last and northernmost of the 21 California missions.

                      In Mendocino County, Highway 128 begins just northwest of Cloverdale and snakes its way through the Yorkville Highlands—an appellation consisting of approximately 40,000 acres straddling Highway 128—to Anderson Valley and Boonville—the home of "boontling"—and then under a canopy of redwoods to mile marker 0 at Highway 1 and the Navarro River Bridge. Along the way, stop and savor not just the wine but the beauty of the surroundings. From the "Petit Tetons" of Yorkville to the deep end of Anderson Valley, 29 tasting rooms, and many others open by appointment only, offer fine wines, a chance to meet the winemaker, and exceptional hospitality.

                        Mendocino County is home to  11 diverse AVAs, from the smallest in the U.S., Cole Ranch at just under one-quarter square mile,  to Mendocino Ridge, often dubbed "Islands in the Sky," the only non-contiguous AVA in the U.S. with only vineyards that sit at 1,200 feet or above are included.  The region covers more than a quarter-million acres of mountainous land, but just 75 acres of the entire viticultural area are planted. Anderson Valley is now famed for its Alsace varietals and Pinot Noir, both of which are celebrated at festivals every February and May, respectively.

                      With 24 state parks, national forest lands, and the only land-based portion of the entire 1,100-mile California Coastal National Monument, Mendocino  County is prime time for hikers. Newly opened in 2016, is additional access to the southern portion of the Lost Coast with its strangely shaped "candelabra trees." The county's rivers, lakes and over 90 miles of unspoiled Pacific coastline provide plenty of opportunities for kayaking, canoeing and boating.

                      Locally raised and grown food is at the heart of Mendocino County's culinary excellence. The first county in the U.S. to ban GMOs, Mendocino County takes food seriously! Foodies delight in chowing down at local restaurants that feature foraged fare, local grass-fed beef, wild-caught seafood and acorn-fed piggies. Diners can take their pick among restaurants offering menus with exquisite vegan cuisine as the star to the season’s best foods prepared in a uniquely refined rustic style.

                      Much of the village of Mendocino and the Headlands is on the National Register of Historic Places so visitors are immersed in history from the moment they arrive. Another gem in the village is the Temple of Kwan Tai, one of the oldest continuously used Chinese temples in California and the only remaining joss house on the northern California coast. Inland, just outside of Ukiah, is the City of 10,000 Buddhas, home to a large international Buddhist community and sited on one of the state's former mental institutions. In Willits, the Skunk Train, which has run for over 130 years, takes visitors on windy rides up mountains and through the redwoods, or in Fort Bragg along the wildlife corridor of the Noyo River.

                      "Local" is the watchword for Mendocino County foods and products. During the year, Farmers' Markets pitch their tents at locations around the county offering local and organic bounty. Throughout the county, visitors can sample Made in Mendocino items such as cheese and chocolate, peppers and pies, as well as art, photography, and textiles.
